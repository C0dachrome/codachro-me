                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>I started this project with the goal of creating a single device that acts like the Swiss Army Knife
                    of
                    RF analysis tools. The Spectrum Eye is designed to be portable, powerful, and versatile, capable of
                    performing a wide range of RF analysis tasks on the go.
                    It combines a Raspberry Pi 4b running Kali Linux with an NESDR Mini 2+ SDR dongle for RF signal
                    reception and analysis. The device includes a Netgear R6020 router,
                    allowing it to create its own Wi-Fi access point for local connectivity. Through the dashboard web
                    interface, users can control the SDR and do various RF and Wi-Fi tasks.
                    Currently, the Spectrum Eye's capabilities include Wi-Fi scanning and basic signal analysis. Future
                    plans include adding features like spectrum visualization, pentesting tools,
                    and more features using the SDR's capabilities. The device can be accessed remotely via a Cloudflare
                    tunnel that is linked in this very website, allowing users to control it from anywhere.
                    The web dashboard includes both pre configured commands as well as a textbox in which users can
                    input their own commands to be executed on the device. This allows for lots of versatility and
                    flexibility.
                    In the future, I plan to further expand the Spectrum Eye's capabilities in a few ways, including but
                    not limited to: Replacing the NESDR with a HackRF for transmission capabilities and increased
                    instantaneous
                    bandwidth, more effectively integrating a battery pack, and adding more advanced RF analysis and
                    pentesting tools to the web interface. I also plan to create a Github repository to which the
                    Raspberry Pi is linked,
                    so that I can more easily make changes and document the project.
